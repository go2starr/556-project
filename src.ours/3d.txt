The global routing grid is 3x3x2 (it has two layers)

Layer 1 has vertical capacity = 0 and horizontal capacity = 1. This means that at most one route can pass from a 'horizontal edge' in order to avoid overflow.

Layer 2 has horizontal capacity = 0 and vertical capacity = 1.

The global routing grid starts from from offset point (x=0,y=0) (same for each layer so no need to specify z). Each global bin defined by the global routing grid-graph has height=10 and width=10 units.

This benchmark instance only has one net. 
Net name = A
Net ID = 0
Net has two terminals
Net size = 1 (ignored for the project)

The location of first pin of net A is (5,5,1). This is with respect to the placement grid. It needs to be translated to find the corresponding vertex on the global routing grid-graph.

Similarly the location of the second pin in (25,5,1) according to the placement grid.

Four edges are identified to have blockage. Notice each edge is identified by two consecutive points. The capacity of the blocked edges should be replaced with 0.
