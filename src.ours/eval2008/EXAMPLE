There are 1 input file and 2 solution files in this zipped file.
You can run eval2008.pl with these files. Assume you are using Linux/Unix, you
should be able to get the following results.

Notes: As you can see, although solution 3ds1 have more wirelength than 3ds2,
3ds1 is superior to 3ds2 because it has less total-overflow.

$ eval2008.pl 3d.txt 3ds1.txt
File Names(In, Out)                         Tot OF       Max OF             WL
3d.txt, 3ds1.txt                                 0            0             14
$ eval2008.pl 3d.txt 3ds2.txt
File Names(In, Out)                         Tot OF       Max OF             WL
